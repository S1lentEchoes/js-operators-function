# js-operators-function

A simple function for calling mathematical operators when needed.

This is a pretty common function, and I am sure there are tons of these out there (either exactly alike, or very similar).  This can be called by other functions for needed mathematical operations (in case a function has need to call more than one, dynamically).  Mostly, I just uploaded this for safe keeping and/or playing around with.

The calling syntax for this operation is - operators[operation_needed](a, b).
